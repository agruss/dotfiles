Configurations repository.

## nvim

*Remarks: There are still some LSP configs missing.*

Since the plugin configs are currently not shipped (yet ;-) ), you need to do some after-steps:

 * `:PackerInstall` in `packer.lua`
 * Install required lspconfigs with **Mason** - before do a `:MasonUpdate` in `mason.lua`

## neomutt

*Remarks: This is still heavy work in progress.*

For the passwords we use `pass`.
