# Dotfiles

Configurations repository.

## nvim

*Remarks: There are still some LSP configs missing.*

Since the plugin configs are currently not shipped (yet ;-) ), you need to do some after-steps:

 * `:PackerInstall` in `packer.lua`
 * Install required lspconfigs with **Mason** - before do a `:MasonUpdate` in `mason.lua`
